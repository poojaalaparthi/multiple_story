        <p>Chennai Super Kings (CSK) is a professional cricket franchise based in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India, that competes in the Indian Premier League. Founded in 2008, the team plays its home matches at the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. The team is owned by India Cements through its Chennai Super Kings Cricket Limited holding company. They have won a record five IPL titles (shared with Mumbai Indians), appeared in a record 10 finals and have qualified for the playoff stages 12 times out of the 14 seasons they have played, more than any other team.[1] The team has been captained by MS Dhoni since inception and is currently coached by Stephen Fleming.

<p>The team was suspended for two years from the IPL starting July 2015 due to the involvement of its owners in the 2013 IPL betting case,[3] and won the title in its comeback season of 2018. In addition, they have also won the Champions League Twenty20 in 2010 and 2014. They are the second most valuable IPL franchise with a valuation of roughly $1.15 billion as of 2022.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In September 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced the establishment of the Indian Premier League, a Twenty20 competition to be started in 2008.[5] In January 2008, the BCCI unveiled the owners of eight city-based franchises. The Chennai franchise was sold to the India Cements for $91 million, making it the fourth most expensive team in the league behind Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad.[6] India Cements acquired the rights to the franchise for 10 years. Former ICC Chairman N. Srinivasan was the de facto owner of the Chennai Super Kings, by means of his position as the vice-chairman and managing director of India Cements Ltd. The franchisee was transferred to a separate entity named Chennai Super Kings Cricket Ltd., after the Supreme Court of India struck down the controversial amendment to the BCCI constitution's clause 6.2.4 that allowed board officials to have a commercial interest in the IPL and the Champions League Twenty20 on 22 January 2015</p>
   <h2>Home ground</h2>
   <p>The home ground of the Super Kings is the historic M. A. Chidambaram Stadium (commonly called "The Chepauk") located in Chennai. The stadium is named after former BCCI President M. A. Chidambaram. It is one of the oldest stadiums in India which is in continuous use. The stadium is owned by the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association and has a seating capacity of 50,000 as of May 2013.[87] In 2010, the stadium underwent a major renovation for hosting some of the matches of the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup. The seating capacity was increased from 36,000 to 50,000 and three new stands were established during this renovation.

    The Super Kings have a 70.91% win record at this venue, which is often referred to as "Fortress Chepauk"[88] and "Lions' den".[89] In the 2011 season, the Super Kings won all their home games (8 matches) including the final against Royal Challengers Bangalore. The Super Kings thus became the first team to win all their home games in a season and also the first team to win the tournament at home.</p>
